EXAMPLE1_configuration_file and EXAMPLE1_interconnectivity_set will allow you to simulate a brain model made of 14 regions

In order to obtain the .CSV of the model activity in the folder experiments/EXAMPLE1, you can use the following "experiment command":
.\start.bat .\...\EXAMPLE1_configuration_file.xml .\...\EXAMPLE1_interconnectivity_set EXAMPLE1 16383

Note that 16383 represents the mask to obtain the activity of all 14 nodes in output
