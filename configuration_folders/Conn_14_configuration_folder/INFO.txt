Conn_14_configuration_file and Conn_14_interconnectivity_set will allow you to simulate a brain model composed of 14 regions

In order to obtain the .CSV of the model activity in the folder experiments/Conn_14, you can use the following "experiment command":
.\start.bat .\...\Conn_14_configuration_file.xml .\...\Conn_14_interconnectivity_set Conn_14 16383

Note that 16383 represents the mask to obtain the activity of all 14 nodes in output
