=====

FNS is an event-driven Spiking Neural Network framework, oriented to 
data-driven brain simulations. FNS combines spiking/synaptic level 
description with the event-driven approach, allowing the user to define 
heterogeneous modules and multi-scale connectivity with delayed connections 
and plastic synapses, providing fast simulations at the same time.
FNS is written in JAVA.
It comes with the GPLv3 (please see LICENSE).
